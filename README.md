# Arduino Butterfly Lamp

"Upgrade" your Ikea Upplyst butterfly lamp to a more active LED lamp using an Arduino. Ofcourse all at your own risk, no permission was given by the product's manufacturer. As described in other projects, I am not a professional programmer or have any education in electronics, so some own improvements may be in order.
